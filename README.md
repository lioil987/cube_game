# Pygame Cube Runner Game

![Game Preview](preveiw/Screenshot.png)

This Python script (`cube_game.py`) uses the Pygame library to create a simple cube runner game. The player controls a cube character that must navigate through obstacles while collecting points.

## Features

- **Infinite Runner:** The game has an endless scrolling environment with randomly generated obstacles.
- **Player Controls:** Use the arrow keys to control the cube character (up, down, left, right).
- **Obstacle Generation:** Obstacles are randomly generated with varying sizes, colors, and speeds.
- **Scoring System:** The player scores points for successfully navigating through obstacles. The game keeps track of the player's score.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
   - Install the Pygame library using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```

2. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python cube_game.py
     ```

3. **Game Controls:**
   - Use the arrow keys to control the cube character:
     - UP: Move Up
     - DOWN: Move Down
     - LEFT: Move Left
     - RIGHT: Move Right

## Game Over and Restart

- The game ends when the cube collides with an obstacle.
- After a game over, you can restart the game by following the on-screen instructions.

## Customize the Game
